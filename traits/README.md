# Traits

** Shared Behavior between different Data Types **

Although I understand the basics of traits, I would still like to
experiment with traits and play around with trait bounds aswell use play
around with some of the features that you get use alongside Traits.

### Questions

##### Question 1: Trait Bounds
Trait Bounds, how do they work, why are they helpful.

##### Question 2: Associated Types
Associated Types, why use them over generics?

```rust
trait CustomIterator {
    type Item;
}
```

##### Question 3: Default Generic Type Parameters

##### Question 4: Using keyword impl

##### Question 5: Using keyword dyn
