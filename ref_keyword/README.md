# Ref Keyword

Although I'm not 100% sure of what the ref keyword does I do have an 
idea. From what I've seen, I believe that the ref keyword gives you a
references when you would usually be taking ownership of a value. From
my current idea of the behavior it attributes, it seems like it would be
helpful in pattern matching and similar situations where you don't want
to consume a value and rather just use a reference.

### Conclusion

The ref keyword is simple, but enables a really helpful language feature
for developers. Not consuming a value when you just need a reference,
especially in the sense of pattern matching could be really helpful in
some circumstances and this enables that.
