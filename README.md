# learning_rust

**A catalog of small projects to learn rust in small sized bits.**

This repository will contain multiple crates where I will build small-scale applications and/or tests to learn rust. Each crate will be focused on an aspect of rust, from using the ref keyword to more complicated subjects such as declarative and procedural macros, as well as containing a README.md. I will try my best to document my learning experience so that future developers can later use this work for reference when learning. The README.md will be formatted in such a way where I will initially write questions or what I plan on learning and then an account of the development process. It will hopefully finish off with a paragraph or two describing what Iâ€™ve learned.
